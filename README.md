## Installation
1. Install (poetry 1.12)[https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer]. You can use the official installer or the `pipx` installer, whichever you prefer. 
2. Poetry will create a new virtualenv for this project automatically. If you manage your virtualenvs yourself or with `pyenv` like me create a new virtualenv for this project and set `poetry config virtualenvs.create false --local`.
3. `poetry install` and all pip packages will install.
